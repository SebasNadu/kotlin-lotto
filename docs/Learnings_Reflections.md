# Lotto Project – Learnings & Reflections

## Technical Skills and Practices
- Applied **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** consistently, finding a balance between strict and flexible approaches.
- Strengthened **refactoring techniques**, using **first-class collections** to improve code clarity and maintainability.
- Gained practical insight into **inheritance vs. composition**, learning when to favor composition to avoid fragile designs.
- Implemented **annotations and value classes** to optimize primitive wrappers and enhance type safety.
- Explored a **creational pattern** using static collections to manage instances efficiently, improving memory locality and performance.
- Deepened understanding of **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)** in Kotlin and their expressive power.
- Applied **polymorphism** to adapt solutions to varying conditions.
- Investigated **design patterns** such as State and Template Method for flexible and reusable architectures.

## Collaboration and Communication
- Improved **pair programming** effectiveness by aligning on conventions, workflows, and shared understanding before coding.
- Enhanced **communication skills** by learning from different problem-solving approaches during pair sessions.
- Actively sought and integrated **feedback** from peers and reviewers to refine both technical and interpersonal skills.
- Adopted a practice of **critical questioning** (“Do I truly understand this?”) to deepen learning and avoid surface-level knowledge.

## Personal and Professional Growth
- Developed stronger **time management** strategies after experiencing both late and on-time submissions.
- Built awareness of **optimal working patterns** (best energy window between 9 a.m.–7 p.m.).
- Balanced learning with personal well-being by reintroducing workouts and routines alongside project deadlines.
- Learned to embrace **continuous improvement** in both coding practices and team collaboration.
